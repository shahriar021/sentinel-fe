 Responsive Design

Grid Layout: Tailwind classes ensure responsiveness:

Mobile: grid-cols-1

Small screens: grid-cols-2

Medium screens: grid-cols-3

Large screens: grid-cols-4

MovieCard scales with hover effect for better UX.

Watch-later and recently viewed sections adapt to screen size.

Unit Testing with Jest

In this project, Jest along with React Testing Library is used to write unit tests for React components.

So far, tests have been implemented for:

MovieCard Component

Checks that the movie title renders correctly.

Ensures the “Watch Later” button behaves properly when wrapped in WatchLaterProvider context.

ErrorMessage Component

Verifies that the error message text is displayed correctly.

Confirms that the component renders without crashing.

These tests help ensure that core UI components behave as expected and make future refactoring safer.
